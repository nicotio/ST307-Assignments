*1. Create a new library called "Week7".;

LIBNAME Week7 "C:\Users\nicot\Desktop\Week7";

/*
2. Read in the FastFood.csv file with a single DATA step and the following
specifications:
a) Save the data set as "FastFood" in the Week7 library.
b) Use the proper informat for the "Price" variable.
c) Make a new variable "Ratio" which is a relative ratio of Sodium to the standard
1,500mg daily allowance.
d) Create a new variable that hides the brand names except the initial character.
e) A new categorical variable would be created by the following code.
IF Ratio > 0.8 THEN SodiumLevel= "Salty" ;
ELSE SodiumLevel="Healthy";
g) Display the "Ratio" variable in percentage format.
h) Display the "Price" variable with dollar sign and two digits right to decimal
point.
i) Display the "Calories" variable with comma. (e.g. 2,400)

/*
3a) Create a new data set called McDonalds utilizing the SET and WHERE
statements. The new data set should only include McDonaldsâ€™ data.
3b) Make a new variable called "Price_Dollar" which is the smallest integer that is
greater than or equal to the "Price" value.
(You may see CEIL function is useful.)
3c) Keep only "SodiumLevel" and "Price_Dollar" variables in the final dataset.
3d) Display a dollar sign for "Price_Dollar" variable*/

a) Create a new data set called BurgerKing that includes only Burger King data
